# Project descriptions
     1.Rock vs mine prediction:
           - this model using logistic regression predicts whether readings of sonar are for mine or rock.
     2.Spam mail prediction:
           - we perform feature extraction data using Tfidf vectorizer to remove stop words,
           the data then is used to train model on logistic regression,which predicts if given
           mail is spam or ham.
     3.Wine Quality Prediction
           - model is trained using random forest classifier to predict the quality of wine
           - only wine with quality > 7 qualifies as good quality wine hence its label is 1 
           whereas for wine with quality < 7 is not a great qualtiy rating hence its label is o.
