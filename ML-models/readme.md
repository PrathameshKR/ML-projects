# Project descriptions
     1.Rock vs mine prediction:
           - this model using logistic regression predicts whether readings of sonar are for mine or rock.
     2.Spam mail prediction:
           - we perform feature extraction data using Tfidf vectorizer to remove stop words,
           the data then is used to train model on logistic regression,which predicts if given
           mail is spam or ham.
     3.Wine Quality Prediction
           - model is trained using random forest classifier to predict the quality of wine
           - only wine with quality > 7 qualifies as good quality wine hence its label is '1' 
           whereas for wine with quality < 7 is not a great qualtiy rating hence its label is '0'.
     4.Parkinsons disease prediction
           - standardized data is used to train model which use SVC to predict if the person has 
           parkinsons disease or not.
     5.Movie recommendation system
           - various features are combined together,which are then assigned weights using TFidf vectorizer
           - cosine similarity function is used to find closest vectors to input vectors and then the output
           is displayed.
     6.Loan status prediction
     7.House price prediction
     8.Heart disease prediction
     9.Fake news prediction
     10.Diabetes prediction
     11.Customer Segmentation
     12.Calories Burnt prediction
     13.Breast cancer classification
     14.Big mart sales prediction
